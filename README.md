## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## To run locally
Make sure to have Node.js 20.10 or later Installed.

1. Clone the project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dennisonung/anji-backend
   ```

2. At the root of the project, download the required dependences 

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Download the .env.local somewhere privately somewhere and drop it into the root of the project

4. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
